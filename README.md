# XMPro AI Agents & Multi-Agent Repository

> Welcome to the XMPro AI Agents repository! This project focuses on generative AI agents and Multi-Agent systems within the XMPro ecosystem, aiming to enhance industrial capabilities through advanced AI technologies.


## About XMPro AI Agents

XMPro AI Agents represent a cutting-edge approach to industrial process optimization and decision-making. By leveraging generative AI and multi-agent systems, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in industrial automation and intelligent operations.

Our system is built on the concept of Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS), which integrate computational software agents with large language models to create dynamic, adaptive systems capable of enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision-making across various operational aspects.

## Key Features

- **Generative AI Agents**: Autonomous AI entities capable of recognizing patterns, generating predictions, and performing complex tasks.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: A platform where multiple AI agents work together, each with its own expertise and role.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: Agents can create and modify plans to achieve goals, adapting to changing circumstances in their environment.
- **Integration with Industrial Systems**: Seamless connection with real-time sensors, business applications, and other data sources through XMPro Data Streams.

## Repository Structure
- [`/docs`](docs): Comprehensive documentation (see Documentation section for details)
- [`/src`](src): Source code for XMPro MAGS components

## Documentation
Our comprehensive documentation is organized in the `/docs` folder:
- [`/architecture`](docs/architecture): Detailed architecture diagrams for MAGS sub-processes
- [`/naming-conventions`](docs/naming-conventions): Explanation of naming conventions used throughout the project
- [`/technical-details`](docs/technical-details): In-depth technical explanations with diagrams
- [`/concepts`](docs/concepts): Exploration of key concepts, ideas, and methodologies underlying XMPro AI Agents
- [`Glossary.md`](docs/Glossary.md): A comprehensive glossary covering:
  - Fundamental concepts in generative AI
  - Multi-Agent system architectures
  - XMPro-specific terminology and tools
  - Industry-standard AI and machine learning terms

For a quick start, we recommend beginning with the [Glossary](/docs/Glossary.md) to familiarize yourself with key concepts and terminology used in the XMPro AI Agents project.
