## Terms

### A
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: A set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility of web content and applications. In XMPro MAGS, ARIA is implemented in the web UI pages to enhance their accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies. ARIA helps convey structure, functionality, and updates to screen readers and other assistive technologies, ensuring that all users can effectively interact with these key interfaces.

### D
- **Deontic Principles**: Deontic principles come from a branch of logic that deals with duty, obligation, and permission. In XMPro MAGS, we use these ideas to set clear rules for our AI agents. These rules tell the agents:
   - What they must do (obligations)
   - What they can do (permissions)
   - What they must not do (prohibitions)

### G
- **Generative Agents**: A generative agent is an advanced AI entity designed to autonomously recognize patterns, generate predictions, and perform tasks by emulating human reasoning. Unlike traditional computational software, generative agents are trained on extensive data sets to understand context and make informed decisions. They can process large amounts of data, adapt to new information, and optimize workflows, making them valuable for automating complex processes and enhancing productivity across various applications.

### M
- **MAG Components**: The platform's foundation is built on multi-agent collaboration, where each generative agent is an autonomous unit endowed with subject matter expertise pertinent to its roleâ€”such as a Reliability Engineer or Quality Inspector.  The various components of a MAGS are:
   - Agent Profile (Template)
   - Agent (Instance of a profile)
   - Task & Task Management
   - Rules of Engagement
   - Tools
   - Functions
   - Processes
   - Teams
   - Collaboration
   - Reasoning Styles
   - Memory Systems

- **Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS) represent an advanced integration of computational software agents and large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate and optimize complex industrial processes and interactions. MAGS leverage generative AI to create dynamic, adaptive systems that can enhance productivity, efficiency, and decision-making across various operational aspects.

### O
- **OpenTelemetry**: An observability framework for cloud-native software, providing a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze software performance and behavior.

### P
- **PPDL**: Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal language used to describe planning problems in artificial intelligence, specifically for "classical" planning tasks. Introduced in 1998 by Drew McDermott and his colleagues, PDDL was designed to provide a standardized way to encode planning problems, facilitating their use in AI research and applications. Since its inception, PDDL has become the de facto standard for representing planning problems in AI research and has evolved through several versions, each enhancing its expressivity and capabilities.

### X
- **XMPro Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: Based on the research papers and your existing definition, here's an updated definition for XMPro MAGS:

XMPro Multi-Agent Generative Systems (XMPro MAGS) are advanced computational frameworks that integrate intelligent software agents with large language models (LLMs) to simulate, optimize, and evolve complex industrial processes and human-like interactions. These systems create dynamic, adaptive environments where multiple AI agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities, collaborate to address challenges and improve outcomes across various operational domains.

   **Key features of XMPro MAGS**

1. Cognitive Simulation: XMPro MAGS agents operate through a sophisticated cycle of observation, memory formation, reflection, planning, and action. This process mirrors human cognitive functions, allowing agents to learn from experiences, form long-term memories, and make informed decisions.

2. Dynamic Interaction: Agents in XMPro MAGS can interact with each other and their environment, forming relationships, sharing information, and coordinating activities. This enables the simulation of complex social dynamics and emergent behaviors within industrial settings.

3. Continuous Learning and Evolution: XMPro MAGS employ strategies like MedAgent-Zero, allowing agents to evolve and improve their performance over time without manually labeled data. This self-improvement occurs through practice, reflection on past experiences, and adaptation to new scenarios.

4. Ethical and Governance Framework: XMPro MAGS are designed to operate within established ethical, legislative, and business governance frameworks. Agents adhere to predefined rules of engagement, ensuring alignment with organizational values, regulatory requirements, and industry standards.

5. Versatile Application: While initially focused on industrial processes, XMPro MAGS can be applied to various scenarios, from healthcare simulations to social system prototyping. They offer a sophisticated approach to problem-solving, process optimization, and innovation across diverse environments.

6. Realistic Environment Simulation: XMPro MAGS can create detailed, interactive environments (like Agent Hospital) that mimic real-world settings. These environments allow for comprehensive testing, training, and scenario planning without real-world risks.

7. Generative Capabilities: Leveraging LLMs, XMPro MAGS can generate human-like responses, create plans, and produce detailed simulations of complex processes. This generative aspect allows for creative problem-solving and the exploration of novel solutions.

8. Scalability and Flexibility: XMPro MAGS can be scaled to handle large numbers of agents and complex scenarios. The system is flexible enough to adapt to different industrial contexts and can be customized to meet specific organizational needs.

By combining multi-agent collaboration with advanced generative AI capabilities, XMPro MAGS offers a powerful tool for simulating, optimizing, and innovating in industrial and business environments. It provides a platform for testing theories, prototyping solutions, and driving continuous improvement while maintaining responsible and compliant behavior.
