## Terms

### A
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: A set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility of web content and applications. In XMPro MAGS, ARIA is implemented in the web UI pages to enhance their accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies. ARIA helps convey structure, functionality, and updates to screen readers and other assistive technologies, ensuring that all users can effectively interact with these key interfaces.

### D
- **Deontic Principles**: Deontic principles come from a branch of logic that deals with duty, obligation, and permission. In XMPro MAGS, we use these ideas to set clear rules for our AI agents. These rules tell the agents:
   - What they must do (obligations)
   - What they can do (permissions)
   - What they must not do (prohibitions)

### G
- **Generative Agents**: A generative agent is an advanced AI entity designed to autonomously recognize patterns, generate predictions, and perform tasks by emulating human reasoning. Unlike traditional computational software, generative agents are trained on extensive data sets to understand context and make informed decisions. They can process large amounts of data, adapt to new information, and optimize workflows, making them valuable for automating complex processes and enhancing productivity across various applications.

### H
- **Hallucination**: A phenomenon in large language models where the AI generates false, fabricated, or nonsensical information that appears plausible. This occurs due to the model's lack of true understanding, instead relying on learned patterns to produce text. Hallucinations can manifest as incorrect facts, non-existent entities, or logical inconsistencies, posing challenges for AI reliability and accuracy.

### M
- **MAG Components**: The platform's foundation is built on multi-agent collaboration, where each generative agent is an autonomous unit endowed with subject matter expertise pertinent to its roleâ€”such as a Reliability Engineer or Quality Inspector.  The various components of a MAGS are:
   - Agent Profile (Template)
   - Agent (Instance of a profile)
   - Task & Task Management
   - Rules of Engagement
   - Tools
   - Functions
   - Processes
   - Teams
   - Collaboration
   - Reasoning Styles
   - Memory Systems

- **Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS) represent an advanced integration of computational software agents and large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate and optimize complex industrial processes and interactions. MAGS leverage generative AI to create dynamic, adaptive systems that can enhance productivity, efficiency, and decision-making across various operational aspects.

### O
- **OpenTelemetry**: An observability framework for cloud-native software, providing a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze software performance and behavior.

### P
- **PPDL**: Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal language used to describe planning problems in artificial intelligence, specifically for "classical" planning tasks. Introduced in 1998 by Drew McDermott and his colleagues, PDDL was designed to provide a standardized way to encode planning problems, facilitating their use in AI research and applications. Since its inception, PDDL has become the de facto standard for representing planning problems in AI research and has evolved through several versions, each enhancing its expressivity and capabilities.

### X
- **XMPro Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: 
MAGS (Multi-Agent Generative Systems) are dynamic teams of virtual workers powered by advanced artificial intelligence. These self-organizing teams work continuously to optimize operational outcomes and achieve specified goals. Key features of MAGS include:

   - Anticipatory and Goal-Seeking: They proactively identify and work towards operational objectives.
   - Always-On: They operate 24/7, constantly monitoring and responding to changes in their environment.
   - Agency: Each virtual worker has the ability to make decisions and take actions independently.
   - Reasoning and Decision-Making: They use advanced AI to analyze situations, solve problems, and make informed choices.

MAGS combine the power of large language models with specialized AI agents to simulate complex processes, optimize operations, and adapt to changing conditions. This makes them valuable tools for improving efficiency and innovation across various industries and operational scenarios.
