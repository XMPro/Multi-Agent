## Terms

### A
- **Agents**: Autonomous AI entities within Multi-Agent Generative Systems that perform specific tasks. There are three main types:
 
   1. Content Agents: Focus on gathering, analyzing, and producing information using LLMs.
   2. Decision Agents: Analyze data and make informed decisions using LLMs for reasoning.
   3. Hybrid Agents: Combine capabilities of both Content and Decision Agents.
 
   Agents work collaboratively to optimize complex industrial processes and enhance productivity.

- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: A set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility of web content and applications. In XMPro MAGS, ARIA is implemented in the web UI pages to enhance their accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies. ARIA helps convey structure, functionality, and updates to screen readers and other assistive technologies, ensuring that all users can effectively interact with these key interfaces.

### C
- **Content Agents**: Specialized AI agents that focus on gathering, analyzing, and producing information. They excel at tasks such as compiling reports, maintaining knowledge bases, and creating documentation. In Content Agents, the Large Language Model (LLM) is primarily used for content generation and curation, making them crucial for managing and synthesizing data in industrial operations.

### D
- **Decision Agents**: AI agents that form the core of Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS) in industrial settings. They analyze data, evaluate options, and make informed decisions based on deep knowledge of processes, quality standards, and operational metrics. In Decision Agents, the LLM is used for reasoning that includes observing, reflecting, planning, and action. These agents typically comprise 60%-70% of the agent team in MAGS.

- **Deontic Principles**: Deontic principles come from a branch of logic that deals with duty, obligation, and permission. In XMPro MAGS, we use these ideas to set clear rules for our AI agents. These rules tell the agents:
   - What they must do (obligations)
   - What they can do (permissions)
   - What they must not do (prohibitions)

### G
- **Generative Agents**: A generative agent is an advanced AI entity designed to autonomously recognize patterns, generate predictions, and perform tasks by emulating human reasoning. Unlike traditional computational software, generative agents are trained on extensive data sets to understand context and make informed decisions. They can process large amounts of data, adapt to new information, and optimize workflows, making them valuable for automating complex processes and enhancing productivity across various applications.

### H
- **Hallucination**: A phenomenon in large language models where the AI generates false, fabricated, or nonsensical information that appears plausible. This occurs due to the model's lack of true understanding, instead relying on learned patterns to produce text. Hallucinations can manifest as incorrect facts, non-existent entities, or logical inconsistencies, posing challenges for AI reliability and accuracy.

- **Hybrid Agents**: Versatile AI agents that combine the capabilities of both Content and Decision Agents. They can gather and analyze information while also making strategic decisions based on that data. Hybrid Agents leverage LLMs for both content generation and reasoning tasks, making them particularly valuable in complex environments where information processing and decision-making are closely linked.

### L
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced artificial intelligence models trained on vast amounts of text data. In Multi-Agent Generative Systems, LLMs are used by Content Agents primarily for content generation and curation, while Decision Agents utilize them for reasoning tasks including observing, reflecting, planning, and action.

### M
- **MAG Components**: The platform's foundation is built on multi-agent collaboration, where each generative agent is an autonomous unit endowed with subject matter expertise pertinent to its roleâ€”such as a Reliability Engineer or Quality Inspector.  The various components of a MAGS are:
   - Agent Profile (Template)
   - Agent (Instance of a profile)
   - Task & Task Management
   - Rules of Engagement
   - Tools
   - Functions
   - Processes
   - Teams
   - Collaboration
   - Reasoning Styles
   - Memory Systems

- **Mixture of Agents (MoA)**: A novel approach in artificial intelligence that leverages multiple large language models (LLMs) to enhance overall performance and capabilities. Key aspects include:
 
   1. Layered Architecture: Uses multiple layers of LLM agents, each processing inputs and generating responses based on outputs from the previous layer.
   
   2. Iterative Refinement: Responses are refined as they pass through multiple layers of agents, leading to more comprehensive and accurate final outputs.
   
   3. Diverse Model Integration: Harnesses the collective expertise of various LLMs, each potentially having unique strengths or specialized knowledge.
   
   4. Collaborative Intelligence: Exploits the inherent collaborativeness of LLMs, where models generate better responses when provided with auxiliary information from other models.
 
   MoA draws inspiration from the Mixture of Experts (MoE) technique in machine learning but applies this concept specifically to language models and focuses on iterative refinement through multiple layers.

- **Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS) represent an advanced integration of computational software agents and large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate and optimize complex industrial processes and interactions. MAGS leverage generative AI to create dynamic, adaptive systems that can enhance productivity, efficiency, and decision-making across various operational aspects.

### O
- **OpenTelemetry**: An observability framework for cloud-native software, providing a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze software performance and behavior.

### P
- **PPDL**: Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal language used to describe planning problems in artificial intelligence, specifically for "classical" planning tasks. Introduced in 1998 by Drew McDermott and his colleagues, PDDL was designed to provide a standardized way to encode planning problems, facilitating their use in AI research and applications. Since its inception, PDDL has become the de facto standard for representing planning problems in AI research and has evolved through several versions, each enhancing its expressivity and capabilities.

### X
- **XMPro Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)**: 
MAGS (Multi-Agent Generative Systems) are dynamic teams of virtual workers powered by advanced artificial intelligence. These self-organizing teams work independently and collaboratively to optimize operational outcomes and achieve specified goals. Key features of MAGS include:

   - **Independence and Agency**: Each virtual worker functions autonomously, making decisions and taking actions independently within their defined scope.
   
   - **Planning and Reflection**: They can plan ahead, reflect on past actions, and adjust strategies accordingly, enabling continuous improvement.
   
   - **Anticipatory and Goal-Seeking**: They proactively identify and work towards operational objectives, always striving for optimal outcomes.
   
   - **Always-On Collaboration**: They operate 24/7, constantly monitoring, communicating, and responding to changes in their environment, ensuring seamless coordination.
   
   - **Adaptive Reasoning and Decision-Making**: They use advanced AI to analyze situations, solve problems, and make informed choices, adapting their execution techniques based on inputs and environmental considerations.
   
   - **Complex Workflow Execution**: They can handle and optimize intricate operational processes with minimal human intervention, streamlining complex tasks.
   
   - **Rules of Engagement**: Agents and teams operate under a structured set of deontic principles, including obligations, permissions, prohibitions, conditional rules, and normative guidelines. These rules govern their behavior, ensure ethical operations, maintain safety standards, and facilitate effective collaboration while providing a framework for autonomous decision-making within predefined boundaries.

MAGS combines the power of large language models with specialized AI agents to simulate complex processes, optimize operations, and adapt to changing conditions. This makes them valuable tools for improving efficiency and driving innovation across various industries and operational scenarios. 

The integration of deontic principles through the Rules of Engagement ensures that MAGS operates efficiently, ethically, and safely, particularly in critical industrial environments where reliability and accountability are paramount.
