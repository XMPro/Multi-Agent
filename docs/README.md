# XMPro AI Agents Documentation

Welcome to the documentation folder for the XMPro AI Agents project. This directory contains comprehensive information about the project's architecture, naming conventions, technical details, and a glossary of key terms.

## Table of Contents

- [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
- [Architecture Diagrams](#architecture-diagrams)
- [Glossary](#glossary)
- [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)
- [Technical Details](#technical-details)
- [Contributing to Documentation](#contributing-to-documentation)

## Folder Structure

- [`accessibility`](accessibility.md): Guidelines and resources for web accessibility, including ARIA implementation
- [`/architecture`](architecture): Contains various diagrams illustrating the system's architecture
- [`Glossary.md`](Glossary.md): Comprehensive list of terms and definitions
- [`/naming-conventions`](naming-conventions): Detailed explanations of naming conventions used in the project
- [`/technical-details`](technical-details): In-depth technical explanations and specifications

## Architecture Diagrams

The [`/architecture`](architecture) folder contains various types of diagrams that illustrate different aspects of our system:

- Interaction Diagrams: Show how different components of the system interact with each other
- Class Diagrams: Illustrate the structure of classes in our object-oriented design
- Sequence Diagrams: Depict the sequence of interactions between objects in various scenarios
- Component Diagrams: Show the organization and dependencies between software components
- Deployment Diagrams: Illustrate the physical deployment of artifacts on hardware

While these diagrams cover different aspects of the system, they all contribute to understanding the overall architecture and are therefore included in the architecture folder.

## Glossary

[`Glossary.md`](docs/Glossary.md) is a comprehensive document that defines key terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout the XMPro AI Agents project. It covers:

- Fundamental concepts in generative AI
- Multi-Agent system architectures
- XMPro-specific terminology and tools
- Industry-standard AI and machine learning terms

We recommend starting with the Glossary to familiarize yourself with the terminology used throughout the documentation.

## Naming Conventions

Our project uses specific naming conventions for different components. Detailed documentation can be found in the `/naming-conventions` folder:

- [`Id.md`](naming-conventions/Id.md): Explains the naming convention for team IDs, agent profile IDs, and agent instance IDs
- [`message-broker-topic.md`](naming-conventions/message-broker-topic.md): Outlines the naming convention for message broker topics used in the system

## Technical Details

The [`/technical-details`](technical-details) folder contains in-depth explanations of various technical aspects of the project. This includes:

- Agent status monitoring and error handling
- Detailed explanations of algorithms used
- Specifications of data structures
- Description of key processes and workflows
