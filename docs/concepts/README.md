## Overview

The XMpro AI Agents system is built on a foundation of advanced concepts in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and industrial process optimization. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and how they are applied in our system.

## Key Concepts

This folder contains detailed explanations of various concepts, including but not limited to:

1. [Deontic Principles](deontic-principles.md): The application of deontic logic in governing agent behavior.
2. [Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)](pddl.md): The standardized language for defining planning problems and domains in AI, and its implementation in XMPro MAGS.

## Document Structure

Each concept document follows a standard structure:

1. **Introduction**: A brief overview of the concept and its relevance to XMPro MAGS.
2. **Core Concepts**: Key ideas or components of the concept.
3. **Implementation in XMPro MAGS**: How the concept is applied in our system, including technical details where relevant.
4. **Importance in Industrial Applications**: The significance and benefits of the concept in industrial settings.
5. **Real-World Examples**: Practical applications or use cases demonstrating the concept.
6. **Challenges and Considerations**: Potential issues and how they are addressed.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary and future implications.
8. **References**: Relevant academic and industry sources.
9. **Acknowledgements**: (Where applicable) Recognition of key contributors or influences.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders:

- **For Developers**: Understand the theoretical foundations and implementation details of our system.
- **For Project Managers**: Gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of our AI agents.
- **For Clients and End-Users**: Learn about the underlying principles that drive our system's behavior and decision-making processes.

We recommend starting with the [Overview of XMpro MAGS](overview.md) document before diving into specific concepts.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this documentation. If you have suggestions for improvements or new concepts to be added, please follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
