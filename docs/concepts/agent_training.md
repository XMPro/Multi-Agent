# How are MAGS Agents Trained?

MAGS (Multi-Agent Generative Systems) agents operate differently from traditional AI systems that require training on historical datasets. Instead of traditional training, MAGS agents acquire their capabilities through several complementary approaches, with [Agent Profiles](agent_architecture.md#agent-profile) playing a central role in their configuration and operation.

## Agent Profiles

The foundation of each MAGS agent is its Agent Profile, which defines:

- **System Prompt**: Core instructions that shape the agent's role and behavior
- **Skills**: Specific capabilities the agent can utilize
- **Experience Level**: Context for the agent's decision-making depth
- **[Deontic Rules](deontic-principles.md)**: Ethical guidelines and constraints
- **Organizational Rules**: Business-specific operational parameters
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures for evaluating effectiveness
- **Memory Parameters**: Configuration for memory management
- **Decision Parameters**: Settings for decision-making processes
- **Interaction Preferences**: Guidelines for communication
- **Available Tools**: Specific tools the agent can utilize

The Agent Profile ensures consistent, role-appropriate behavior while maintaining clear operational boundaries.
 
## Core Capability Components
 
### 1. Instruction-Based Foundation
Each agent operates based on:
- Their specific Agent Profile configuration
- Clear operational boundaries and decision-making parameters
- Defined interaction patterns with other agents in the team
- System-level rules and constraints
 
### 2. Specialist Knowledge Access (RAG)
Agents use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:
- Access domain-specific knowledge bases and documentation
- Pull relevant information during decision-making processes
- Reference specific technical standards or procedures
- Incorporate up-to-date specialist knowledge into their responses
 
### 3. Memory and Learning System
Agents build understanding through:
- **Observation**: Active gathering of information about current situations
- **Reflection**: Analysis of observations and their implications
- **Memory Storage**: Recording important information and outcomes
- **Experience Application**: Using past experiences to inform future decisions
 
### 4. Specialized Language Models
*Note: Fine-tuned models are only necessary in specific, highly specialized scenarios where general-purpose language models cannot adequately handle domain complexity.*
 
Examples of scenarios that might require specialized models:
- Highly regulated industries with strict compliance requirements
- Complex technical domains with specialized terminology
- Safety-critical systems requiring specific domain knowledge
 
For most applications, the combination of well-configured Agent Profiles, RAG capabilities, and the memory system provides sufficient specialization and expertise.
 
## Key Differences from Traditional AI Training
 
MAGS agents are distinct from traditionally trained AI systems because:
- Configuration is through Agent Profiles rather than training data
- Learning occurs through real-time experience rather than pre-training
- Adaptation comes from actual operational results
- Knowledge access is dynamic and up-to-date
- Each agent maintains a specific role within the team structure
 
## Continuous Operation
 
The system maintains effectiveness through:
1. **Profile-Guided Operation**
   - Consistent behavior based on defined parameters
   - Clear role boundaries and responsibilities
   - Structured decision-making processes
 
2. **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**
   - Real-time access to relevant information
   - Integration of new knowledge through RAG
   - Continuous learning from operational experiences
 
3. **Memory-Based Adaptation**
   - Recording and reflecting on experiences
   - Building contextual understanding
   - Applying learned insights to new situations
 
## Core Principles
- Agent Profiles define specific roles and operational parameters
- Decisions are made based on current context and specialist knowledge
- Learning happens through actual operation rather than pre-training
- Team coordination enables complex problem-solving
- Clear boundaries maintain focused operation
 
This implementation allows MAGS agents to operate effectively in their specific domains while maintaining adaptability and continuous improvement through actual operational experience, guided by their Agent Profiles.
