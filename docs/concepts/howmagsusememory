# How XMPro MAGS Uses Short-Term and Long-Term Memory to Make Better Decisions

At XMPro, we understand that intelligent software agents need both short-term and long-term memory to make effective decisions. Our Multi-Agent System (MAGS) implements a practical approach to memory management that mirrors how humans process and store information. Let me explain how this works and why it matters for businesses.

## Short-Term Memory: Quick Access to Recent Information

MAGS agents use short-term memory to keep track of their current tasks and recent interactions, much like how humans use working memory. This system includes a cache that stores recent observations and experiences for quick access. The cache automatically removes information after 30 minutes of inactivity to prevent memory overload.

Think of short-term memory as a digital workspace where agents actively process information. When an agent engages in a conversation or performs a task, it needs immediate access to relevant context. This quick access helps agents maintain coherent conversations and make faster decisions based on current situations.

## Long-Term Memory: Building Knowledge Over Time

The long-term memory system in MAGS stores five main types of information:

1. Observations: Direct experiences from interactions
2. Reflections: Insights generated from analyzing observations
3. Plans: Records of action sequences and goals
4. Decisions: Documentation of past decision-making processes
5. Actions: History of completed operations

This structured approach helps agents learn from past experiences and apply that knowledge to new situations. We use a combination of graph and vector databases to store this information, which allows agents to find relevant memories quickly and understand the relationships between different pieces of information.

## How MAGS Processes and Uses Memories

When MAGS creates a new memory, it goes through several important steps:

1. The system evaluates how important the information is for long-term storage
2. It creates connections between related pieces of information
3. It generates semantic embeddings for later retrieval
4. It preserves the context in which the memory was created

Over time, memories become less prominent unless they prove useful in ongoing operations. This natural decay helps prevent information overload while keeping valuable knowledge accessible. The system can retrieve memories through direct lookup, semantic search, or by following relationship paths between connected information.

## The Business Impact of Intelligent Memory Management

This memory system helps businesses in several practical ways. Agents can maintain consistent conversations across multiple interactions with users. They can learn from past experiences to improve their future responses. The system helps prevent repeated mistakes by keeping track of what worked and what didn't in previous situations.

For example, when an agent helps with equipment maintenance, it can remember past issues with similar equipment and suggest more effective solutions. This capability becomes more valuable over time as the agent builds up a history of interactions and outcomes.
