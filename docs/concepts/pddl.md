# Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) in XMPro MAGS

## Introduction

Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a standardized format for describing planning problems in artificial intelligence. In XMPro MAGS, PDDL plays a crucial role in enabling our AI agents to understand, plan, and execute complex tasks in industrial environments. This document explores PDDL, its implementation in XMPro MAGS, and its significance in industrial applications.

## Core Concepts

1. **Domain Description**: Defines the types of objects, predicates, and actions available in a planning problem.
2. **Problem Description**: Specifies the initial state and goal state for a particular planning instance.
3. **Action Schemas**: Define the preconditions and effects of actions that can be taken in the domain.

## Key Components of PDDL

PDDL is structured around two main types of files:

1. **Domain File**: Defines the general rules and actions applicable to a planning problem. It includes:
   - Requirements
   - Types
   - Predicates
   - Functions
   - Actions/Operators

2. **Problem File**: Specifies a particular instance of a planning problem. It includes:
   - Objects
   - Initial State
   - Goal Specification

## Evolution of PDDL

PDDL has undergone several revisions to enhance its capabilities:

- **PDDL 1.2** (1998): The original version, focusing on predicate logic.
- **PDDL 2.1** (2002): Introduced durative actions and numeric fluents.
- **PDDL 2.2** (2004): Added derived predicates and timed initial literals.
- **PDDL 3.0** (2004): Included trajectory constraints and preferences.
- **PDDL+** (2015): Enabled modeling of mixed discrete-continuous domains.

## Why PDDL Matters

1. **Standardization**: Provides a common language for expressing planning problems.
2. **Expressiveness**: Capable of representing increasingly complex real-world scenarios.
3. **Modularity**: Separation of domain and problem descriptions allows for reusability.
4. **Scalability**: Supports the development of planning systems that can handle increasingly complex problems.
5. **Research and Competition**: Widely used in AI planning competitions and research.

## Applications and Tools

PDDL finds applications in various domains, including robotics, logistics, manufacturing, and space exploration. Tools and applications include:

- XMPro Data Stream Designer's PDDL Action Agent
- Visual Studio Code with PDDL extension
- Various open-source and commercial planners (e.g., Fast Downward, LAMA, SGPlan)
- Visualization tools for understanding and debugging planning domains and problems

## Implementation in XMPro MAGS

XMPro MAGS leverages PDDL as the foundation for its planning and decision-making processes. Key aspects of our implementation include:

1. **Dynamic Domain Modeling**: Real-time generation of PDDL domain models based on current industrial contexts.
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Extended PDDL constructs to facilitate collaboration between multiple AI agents.
3. **Real-Time Adaptive Planning**: Custom PDDL actions that allow for dynamic plan adjustments based on real-time data.
4. **Integration with XMPro Data Streams**: PDDL problem instances are continuously updated with real-time data from industrial processes.

## Comparison: Traditional vs. PDDL-based Planning in XMPro MAGS

| Aspect | Traditional Planning | PDDL-based Planning in XMPro MAGS |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Flexibility | Limited - Often hardcoded for specific scenarios | High - Easily adaptable to new domains and problems |
| Scalability | Challenging - Requires significant rework for complex problems | Excellent - Scales well to handle increasingly complex scenarios |
| Performance | Variable - Can be fast for simple, predefined scenarios but struggles with complexity | Optimized - Efficient for both simple and complex problems |
| Adaptability | Low - Difficult to modify for changing conditions | High - Can quickly adapt to real-time changes |
| Domain Independence | Low - Usually domain-specific | High - Can be applied across various domains with minimal changes |
| Explainability | Limited - Often operates as a "black box" | High - Plans are human-readable and logically structured |
| Integration with AI/ML | Limited - Often separate from AI/ML systems | Seamless - Easily integrates with other AI components in MAGS |
| Collaborative Planning | Difficult - Challenging to coordinate multiple planners | Native - Supports multi-agent planning out of the box |
| Uncertainty Handling | Poor - Typically assumes a deterministic world | Good - Can incorporate probabilistic outcomes and contingencies |

## Importance in Industrial Applications

PDDL in XMPro MAGS enables:

1. Flexible and adaptable planning for complex industrial processes.
2. Standardized representation of planning problems across different industrial domains.
3. Enhanced interoperability between different components of the MAGS system.
4. Improved explainability of AI decision-making processes.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Predictive Maintenance**: Using PDDL to model equipment states, sensor readings, and maintenance actions for optimized scheduling.
2. **Supply Chain Optimization**: Representing inventory levels, transportation options, and demand forecasts to plan efficient logistics operations.
3. **Process Optimization**: Modeling production steps, resource allocation, and quality constraints to maximize efficiency and output quality.

Here is an example of a PDDL domain definition for a Predictive Maintenance and Root Cause Analysis Agent in XMPro MAGS:

```pddl
(define (domain xmpro-mags-predictive-maintenance)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :durative-actions :fluents :xmpro-mags-extensions)
  (:types 
    equipment component sensor - object
    maintenance-type fault-type - object
    measurement - number)
  (:predicates
    (equipment-operational ?e - equipment)
    (sensor-attached ?s - sensor ?c - component)
    (component-of ?c - component ?e - equipment)
    (needs-maintenance ?e - equipment ?m - maintenance-type)
    (has-fault ?c - component ?f - fault-type)
    (maintenance-in-progress ?e - equipment)
    (diagnosis-complete ?e - equipment))
  (:functions

    (threshold ?s - sensor)
    (equipment-health ?e - equipment)
    (component-wear ?c - component)
    (maintenance-duration ?e - equipment ?m - maintenance-type)
    (xmpro-mags-fault-probability ?c - component ?f - fault-type))
  (:xmpro-mags-adaptive-action monitor-equipment
    :parameters (?e - equipment)
    :precondition (equipment-operational ?e)
    :effect (and 
      (forall (?c - component) 
        (when (and (component-of ?c ?e)
                   (exists (?s - sensor) 
                     (and (sensor-attached ?s ?c)
                          (> (sensor-reading ?s) (threshold ?s)))))
          (decrease (equipment-health ?e) 1)))
      (forall (?c - component)
        (when (component-of ?c ?e)
          (increase (component-wear ?c) 1))))
    :xmpro-mags-real-time-condition (< (equipment-health ?e) 80))
  (:xmpro-mags-adaptive-action diagnose-fault
    :parameters (?e - equipment ?c - component ?f - fault-type)
    :precondition (and (equipment-operational ?e)
                       (component-of ?c ?e)
                       (not (diagnosis-complete ?e)))
    :effect (and 
      (when (> (xmpro-mags-fault-probability ?c ?f) 0.7)
        (and (has-fault ?c ?f)
             (needs-maintenance ?e (fault-maintenance-type ?f))
             (diagnosis-complete ?e))))
    :xmpro-mags-real-time-condition (< (equipment-health ?e) 60))
  (:durative-action perform-maintenance
    :parameters (?e - equipment ?m - maintenance-type)
    :duration (= ?duration (maintenance-duration ?e ?m))
    :condition (and 
      (at start (needs-maintenance ?e ?m))
      (over all (maintenance-in-progress ?e)))
    :effect (and 
      (at start (maintenance-in-progress ?e))
      (at end (not (maintenance-in-progress ?e)))
      (at end (not (needs-maintenance ?e ?m)))
      (at end (increase (equipment-health ?e) 50))
      (forall (?c - component)
        (when (component-of ?c ?e)
          (at end (assign (component-wear ?c) 0))))))
)
```

This PDDL domain definition demonstrates how XMPro MAGS extends standard PDDL to handle real-time, adaptive planning in a predictive maintenance scenario.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Complexity Management**: Balancing the expressiveness of PDDL with computational efficiency for real-time planning.
2. **Domain Expertise**: Requiring domain experts to collaborate with AI specialists in defining accurate PDDL models.
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Extending PDDL to better handle probabilistic outcomes and partial observability in industrial settings.

## Conclusion

PDDL serves as a powerful tool within XMPro MAGS, enabling sophisticated planning and decision-making capabilities. As we continue to develop and refine our PDDL implementation, we anticipate even greater flexibility and effectiveness in addressing complex industrial challenges.
