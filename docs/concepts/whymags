### Traditional Agent Frameworks: Procedural Approach with LLMs

Traditional agent frameworks typically adopt a more procedural programming approach. In these frameworks:

1. **Agent Structure**:
   - Agents are often implemented as code blocks or classes with predefined methods and behaviors.
   - The decision-making logic is usually hardcoded or follows rigid, predefined rules.

2. **LLM Utilization**:
   - LLMs are primarily used as tools for specific tasks such as content generation, text summarization, or question answering.
   - They are not deeply integrated into the decision-making process itself.

3. **Information Processing**:
   - Information is typically processed in a linear, step-by-step manner, with LLMs being called at specific points for specific tasks.
   - There's often a clear separation between data processing (done procedurally) and natural language tasks (delegated to LLMs).

4. **Limited Context Awareness**:
   - These frameworks often lack the sophisticated context gathering and synthesis capabilities of XMPro MAGS.
   - Context is usually limited to what's explicitly provided in the agent's current state or immediate input.

5. **Predefined Workflows**:
   - Agents often follow predetermined paths or decision trees.
   - While these can be complex, they lack the flexibility and adaptability of MAGS' cognitive approach.

6. **Inter-Agent Communication**:
   - Communication between agents is typically more structured and limited, often based on predefined protocols or message formats.
