# Naming Conventions

This folder contains documentation for the various naming conventions used in the XMPro AI Agents project. These conventions are crucial for maintaining consistency, clarity, and efficiency across our system.

## Contents

1. [Id.md](Id.md) - Naming conventions for identifiers
2. [MQTT-Topic.md](MQTT-Topic.md) - Naming conventions for MQTT topics

## Overview

### Id Naming Convention

The [Id naming convention](Id.md) document outlines the structure and rules for creating identifiers for various entities in our system, including:

- Locations
- Teams
- Agent Profiles
- Agent Instances

This convention is based on ISA-95 standards and adapted for our specific needs. It provides a hierarchical structure that clearly identifies the role and context of each entity.

For detailed information, please refer to [Id.md](Id.md).

### MQTT Topic Naming Convention

The [MQTT Topic naming convention](MQTT-Topic.md) document describes the structure and rules for creating MQTT topics in our system. This convention is based on Unified Namespace (UNS) principles and is designed to:

- Facilitate efficient communication
- Allow easy topic filtering
- Maintain alignment with industry standards

For detailed information, please refer to [MQTT-Topic.md](MQTT-Topic.md).

## Usage

When working on any part of the XMPro MAGS, please refer to these naming conventions to ensure consistency. If you're creating new entities, MQTT topics, or working with vector data, these documents will guide you in choosing appropriate names and structures.

## Updating Conventions

As our project evolves, we may need to update these naming conventions. If you believe a convention needs to be modified or extended:

1. Discuss the proposed changes with the team
2. Update the relevant documentation file
3. Ensure all team members are informed of the changes
4. Update any affected code or configurations to reflect the new conventions

## Questions or Suggestions

If you have any questions about these naming conventions or suggestions for improvements, please contact the project lead or raise an issue in our project management system.

Remember, consistent use of these naming conventions is key to maintaining a clean, understandable, and efficient system architecture.
