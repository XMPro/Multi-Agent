### Graph Database

This file provides an in-depth look at our graph database structure. It includes:

- An explanation of the ID structure used in the graph database
- Detailed descriptions of each node type (Team, Agent Profile, Agent Instance, Task, Prompt, Memory)
- Property tables for each node type, outlining the data stored for each entity
- An overview of the relationships between different node types

This document is essential for understanding how data is structured and related within our system.

### Memory Cycle Instantiation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Memory Cycle Instantiation Process. It covers:

- Key components involved in the instantiation process
- The overall process flow and core component interactions
- Configuration initialization and Memory Cycle creation steps
- Agent startup process, including MQTT connection and topic subscription
- Error handling and cleanup procedures
- Key architectural points of the system

This information is crucial for understanding how agents are initialized and integrated into the multi-agent system.

### Open Telemetry Tracing
XMPro MAGS uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to monitor and analyze the performance of our multi-agent system. This helps in debugging, performance optimization, and understanding system behavior.
Key features of our OpenTelemetry implementation:

Consistent naming conventions for activities and tags
Tracing of important operations across all components
Best practices for effective and efficient tracing

For detailed information on how to implement and use OpenTelemetry tracing in MAGS, please refer to our [OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide](open_telemetry_tracing_guide.md).

### Prompt Manager

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our Prompt Management System. It covers:

- A detailed table of fields used in the prompt structure
- Access levels for prompt management
- Category types for organizing prompts
- Data flow within the system
- Error handling and validation
- Functionality and modes of operation
- Performance considerations
- Prompt types and their purposes
- System features and architecture
- The access control system implemented for prompt management
- The MAGS System Prompt Id structure
- The structure of the Prompt Library, including the root node concept
- User interface components

This information is crucial for understanding how prompts are created, stored, managed, and accessed within our system. The document also includes placeholders for screenshots to visually represent key concepts and interfaces.


### Vector Database

This document explains the vector database used for storing and retrieving agent memories. It covers:

- The structure of memory entries in the vector database
- A detailed table of fields used in the memory structure
- The benefits and reasoning behind this structure
- Considerations for implementing and using the vector database

This information is crucial for understanding how agent memories are stored, retrieved, and utilized in our system.
