- Property tables for each node type, outlining the data stored for each entity
- An overview of the relationships between different node types

This document is essential for understanding how data is structured and related within our system.

### Memory Cycle Instantiation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Memory Cycle Instantiation Process. It covers:

- Key components involved in the instantiation process
- The overall process flow and core component interactions
- Configuration initialization and Memory Cycle creation steps
- Agent startup process, including MQTT connection and topic subscription
- Error handling and cleanup procedures
- Key architectural points of the system

This information is crucial for understanding how agents are initialized and integrated into the multi-agent system.

### Prompt Manager

This document details the Prompt Manager component of our system. It covers:

- The structure of the XMPro MAGS System Prompt IDs
- A comprehensive list of fields used in the Prompt Manager
- Explanations and rationales for each field

This information is crucial for understanding how prompts are managed, versioned, and utilized within the system.

### Vector Database

This document explains the vector database used for storing and retrieving agent memories. It covers:

- The structure of memory entries in the vector database
- A detailed table of fields used in the memory structure
- The benefits and reasoning behind this structure
- Considerations for implementing and using the vector database

This information is crucial for understanding how agent memories are stored, retrieved, and utilized in our system.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing
XMPro MAGS uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to monitor and analyze the performance of our multi-agent system. This helps in debugging, performance optimization, and understanding system behavior.
Key features of our OpenTelemetry implementation:

Consistent naming conventions for activities and tags
Tracing of important operations across all components
Best practices for effective and efficient tracing

For detailed information on how to implement and use OpenTelemetry tracing in MAGS, please refer to our [OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide](open_telemetry_tracing_guide.md).
