### Open Telemetry Tracing

XMPro MAGS uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to monitor and analyze the performance of our multi-agent system. This helps in debugging, performance optimization, and understanding system behavior.
Key features of our OpenTelemetry implementation:

- Consistent naming conventions for activities and tags
- Tracing of important operations across all components
- Best practices for effective and efficient tracing

For detailed information on how to implement and use OpenTelemetry tracing in MAGS, please refer to our [OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide](open_telemetry_tracing_guide.md).

### Prompt Injection Protection

The Prompt Injection Protection documentation specifically details how MAGS implements security through:
- Controlled user interfaces for all interactions
- Internal security mechanisms
- System-enforced protections
- Safe usage patterns through provided UIs

For conceptual understanding of prompt injection, see [Prompt Injection Concepts](../concepts/prompt-injection.md).
