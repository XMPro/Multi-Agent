## Use Case Templates

### Safety-Critical Operations

Industrial operations where safety is paramount require specialized MAGS configurations with Byzantine fault tolerance and comprehensive audit trails.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Emergency shutdown coordination with Byzantine consensus
- Hazardous material handling with multi-layer validation
- Critical equipment protection with tiered autonomy
- Safety system integrity monitoring

**Example Scenarios**:
- Chemical plant emergency response
- Nuclear facility safety systems
- Oil & gas critical operations
- Manufacturing hazardous processes

See [Safety-Critical Operations](safety-critical-operations.md) for detailed templates and implementation patterns.

### Multi-Stakeholder Decision-Making

Complex decisions involving multiple parties with different objectives require fair compromise and transparent coordination.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Cross-functional resource allocation using Nash equilibrium
- Production vs. maintenance coordination with multi-objective optimization
- Quality vs. efficiency trade-offs with Pareto optimization
- Multi-site coordination with fair allocation

**Example Scenarios**:
- Manufacturing resource allocation
- Supply chain optimization
- Energy distribution management
- Healthcare resource planning

See [Multi-Stakeholder Decision-Making](multi-stakeholder-decision-making.md) for patterns and examples.
