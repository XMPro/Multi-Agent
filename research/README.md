## Papers

### Neuroscience-Inspired Cognitive Architecture for Multi-Agent Systems
**Date**: September 2025 · [PDF](2025.9.9_Neuroscience-Inspired%20Cognitive%20Architecture%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Systems.pdf)

Explores how principles from neuroscience and cognitive science inform the design of the MAGS cognitive architecture — including memory encoding, reflection, and the observe-reflect-plan-act (ORPA) cycle. Provides the theoretical grounding for how MAGS agents store, retrieve, and reason from experience over time.

### Utility Functions for Industrial Multi-Agent Systems
**Date**: November 2025 · [PDF](Utility_Function_Paper_Nov25.pdf)

Covers the design and application of utility and objective functions in industrial MAGS deployments. Addresses how agents balance competing objectives — economic, operational, safety — through mathematical utility functions, and how constraints interact with utility to produce safe, value-maximising behaviour.

### Senior Manager's Guide to MAGS
**Date**: October 2025 · [PDF](2025.10.22_Senior%20Managers%20Guide%20to%20MAGS.pdf)

A non-technical overview of MAGS for senior leaders and decision-makers. Covers what MAGS is, where it fits in an operational technology stack, how it compares to alternatives, and how organisations should think about adoption, governance, and value realisation.

**Related docs**: [Business FAQ](../docs/faq/business.md) · [Use Cases](../docs/use-cases/README.md) · [Adoption Guidance](../docs/adoption-guidance/README.md) · [When NOT to Use MAGS](../docs/decision-guides/when-not-to-use-mags.md)

### IP Protection for Industrial Agentic Systems
**Date**: February 2026 · [PDF](2026.02.02_IP_Protection_for_Industrial_Agentic_Systems.pdf)

Examines intellectual property considerations specific to industrial agentic systems — including how operational knowledge embedded in agent configurations, utility functions, and memory systems constitutes protectable IP, and what governance frameworks organisations should put in place.
