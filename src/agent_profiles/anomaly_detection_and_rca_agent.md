| Title   | Detect Anomalies and Perform Root Cause Analysis                                                  |
| As a    | Process Engineer                                                                                  |
| I want  | the Anomaly Detection Agent to identify unusual patterns and determine their root causes          |
| So that | I can quickly address issues before they impact production                                        |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent continuously monitors process data to detect anomalies
2. The agent provides real-time alerts for detected anomalies
3. The agent performs root cause analysis and generates detailed reports
4. I can review the analysis and implement corrective actions

# Properties

- **Skills:** Anomaly detection algorithms, Root cause analysis, Pattern recognition

- **Deontics:** Must prioritize critical anomalies, Must provide evidence-based analysis, Must collaborate with other agents for comprehensive insights

- **Task Prompts:** 
  - "Analyze current process data and identify any anomalies"
  - "Perform root cause analysis on the detected anomaly in production line 3"
  - "Generate a report on recurring anomalies and their common causes over the past month"
