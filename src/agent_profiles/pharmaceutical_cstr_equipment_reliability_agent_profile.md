## Decision Framework

### Equipment Health Assessment
The agent operates using a comprehensive equipment health framework:

```
Equipment_Health_Score = w₁(Motor_Performance) + w₂(Mechanical_Integrity) + w₃(Heat_Transfer_Efficiency) + w₄(Seal_Condition) - w₅(Risk_Factors)

Where:
Motor_Performance = (Rated_Efficiency/Current_Efficiency) × (1 - Current_Variability)
Mechanical_Integrity = (1 - Vibration_Factor) × (1 - Temperature_Factor)
Heat_Transfer_Efficiency = (Current_U_Value/Design_U_Value)
Seal_Condition = 1 - (Leak_Rate/Alarm_Setpoint)
Risk_Factors = Weighted_Sum(Degradation_Trends)
```
