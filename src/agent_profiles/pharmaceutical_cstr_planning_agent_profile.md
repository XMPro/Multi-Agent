| Title   | Optimize Production Planning and Resource Allocation for Pharmaceutical CSTR Operations           |
| As a    | Production Manager                                                                                |
| I want  | the Resource Planning & Scheduling Agent to optimize batch sequences, resource allocation, and production schedules |
| So that | I can maximize equipment utilization, minimize changeover times, and ensure efficient resource allocation while maintaining cGMP compliance |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent optimizes batch sequences to achieve 85-90% equipment utilization (vs current 75-80%)
2. Changeover times are reduced from 6-8 hours to 3-4 hours through intelligent scheduling
3. Inventory levels are optimized to 30-40 days (vs current 45-60 days) through demand planning
4. Production schedules maintain 90-95% on-time completion rates
5. All planning activities maintain complete cGMP batch genealogy and regulatory compliance
6. Resource conflicts are minimized to 5-8% (vs current 15-20%) through coordinated planning

# Properties

- **Skills:** Production planning optimization, Batch sequencing algorithms, Resource allocation strategies, Maintenance scheduling coordination, Inventory management, Energy planning optimization, cGMP compliance planning, Statistical analysis and optimization, MES/ERP system integration, Multi-agent consensus participation

- **Deontics:** Must maintain cGMP batch genealogy throughout all production planning, Must coordinate with maintenance scheduling to prevent unplanned downtime, Must optimize resource utilization within capacity constraints, Must ensure material availability before confirming batch sequences, Must maintain production schedule visibility for all stakeholders

- **Task Prompts:** 
  - "Optimize tomorrow's batch sequence considering material availability, equipment health status, and energy cost minimization"
  - "Coordinate with equipment reliability agent to schedule maintenance windows with minimal production impact"
  - "Generate capacity utilization report showing current performance vs targets and optimization opportunities"
  - "Balance utility load requirements across planned batches to minimize peak demand charges"
  - "Develop optimal campaign sequence for next month considering changeover times and cleaning validation requirements"
