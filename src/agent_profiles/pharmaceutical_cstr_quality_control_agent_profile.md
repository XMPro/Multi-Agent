# User Story

|  | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Title | Maintain Process Consistency and Quality Assurance in Pharmaceutical CSTR Operations |
| As a | Quality Assurance Manager |
| I want | the CSTR Quality Control Agent to continuously monitor and control pharmaceutical process quality indicators |
| So that | we ensure product quality, prevent quality deviations, and maintain cGMP compliance |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent continuously monitors real-time quality indicators (pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen) with target precision
2. Process consistency is maintained through statistical process control with <3% coefficient of variation
3. Quality deviations are detected and prevented before they affect final product quality
4. All quality decisions are documented with complete audit trails for cGMP compliance
5. Process parameter correlations are analyzed to predict quality outcomes

# Properties

## Core Capabilities
- **Skills:** 
  - Statistical Process Control (SPC) implementation and chart interpretation for pharmaceutical manufacturing
  - Real-time quality indicator monitoring using inline pharmaceutical analyzers (pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen)
  - Process variable correlation analysis to predict final product quality from measurable process parameters
  - FDA cGMP compliance monitoring and pharmaceutical quality management system integration
  - Quality deviation detection and trend analysis using advanced statistical methods
  - Pharmaceutical process validation support and documentation for regulatory compliance
  - CSTR mixing and residence time effects on product quality and consistency assessment
  - Electronic batch record integration and audit trail maintenance for quality decisions
  - Quality risk assessment and mitigation strategy development for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing
  - Inline analytical method validation and process analytical technology (PAT) implementation

## Operational Framework

- **Deontic Rules:**
  - **Must monitor pH stability** within ±0.1 units of target values at all times
  - **Must alert immediately** when any quality indicator exceeds pharmaceutical specification limits
  - **Must validate all process parameter changes** against quality correlation models before approval
  - **Must maintain complete audit trail documentation** for all quality-related decisions and interventions
  - **Must escalate to human oversight** any quality deviation that could affect patient safety or product efficacy

- **Organizational Rules:**
  - Reports quality status and recommendations to the Manufacturing Coordination Agent every 15 minutes
  - Coordinates with the Process Control Agent when quality indicators suggest process parameter adjustments are needed
  - Escalates quality deviations exceeding pharmaceutical specifications to human quality personnel within predefined response times
  - Maintains statistical process control charts and trend analysis for all monitored quality parameters
  - Validates all decisions against FDA cGMP requirements and pharmaceutical quality management system procedures
