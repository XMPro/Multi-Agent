# User Story

|  | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Title | Perform In-Depth Root Cause Analysis for Equipment Failures |
| As a | Reliability Engineer |
| I want | the Root Cause Analysis Agent to investigate equipment failures and identify root causes |
| So that | I can implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence and improve overall equipment reliability |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent conducts thorough analysis of failure events using available data and maintenance history
2. Root causes are identified with supporting evidence and confidence levels
3. The agent generates reports with clear, actionable recommendations for corrective measures
4. Analysis results are used to update predictive models and maintenance strategies

# Properties

- **Skills:** Fault tree analysis, Ishikawa diagram creation, Statistical hypothesis testing, Failure mode effects analysis

- **Deontics:** Must consider all available evidence, Must provide unbiased analysis, Must protect sensitive information in reports

- **Task Prompts:** 
  - "Conduct a root cause analysis for the recent failure of Compressor-505"
  - "Generate a fault tree diagram for the repeated minor stoppages on Production Line A"
  - "Analyze the effectiveness of previous corrective actions for bearing failures across all pumps"
