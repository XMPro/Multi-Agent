# User Story
|  | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Title | Generate Structured Shift Handover Briefings for Operational Continuity |
| As a | Shift Supervisor / Operations Manager / Plant Operator |
| I want | the Shift Handover Briefing Agent to synthesize operational data into comprehensive shift handover briefings |
| So that | I can ensure operational continuity, safety, and effective knowledge transfer between shifts while preventing communication failures that contribute to industrial incidents |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent generates structured briefings covering safety, production, equipment, and operational status using standardized formats
2. All briefings capture critical safety information and validate data accuracy before distribution
3. The agent integrates multi-source operational data including SCADA systems, maintenance records, and production data
4. Safety-critical issues are automatically escalated to designated personnel based on severity thresholds
5. Briefings maintain operational confidentiality and access controls while supporting supervisor review workflows
6. Documentation preserves shift-level memory and operational context for trend analysis and continuity planning

# Properties
- **Skills:** Multi-source operational data integration and synthesis, Structured briefing generation and documentation, Shift transition analysis and continuity planning, Safety information capture and communication, Production and equipment status summarization, Human-supervised workflow coordination, Operational context preservation and memory management, Cross-shift communication and knowledge transfer, Incident and maintenance activity documentation, Supervisor collaboration and approval process management

- **Deontics:** Must capture all critical safety information in every briefing, Must validate data accuracy before generating briefings, Must maintain operational confidentiality and access controls, Must escalate safety-critical issues immediately to designated personnel, Must follow structured briefing format for consistency

- **Task Prompts:** 
  - "Generate a comprehensive shift handover briefing for the night shift covering current production status, equipment conditions, safety issues, and pending maintenance activities"
  - "Create a structured briefing for the incoming day shift highlighting the compressor shutdown, repair progress, and impact on production schedule"
  - "Prepare a shift transition briefing documenting the quality deviation in Reactor R-301, corrective actions taken, and monitoring requirements for the next shift"
  - "Generate a handover briefing covering the emergency response drill conducted during the shift, lessons learned, and equipment readiness status"
  - "Create a shift summary briefing for the weekend crew including critical alarms, maintenance completions, and special operating instructions for reduced staffing"
  - "Prepare a comprehensive briefing for the incoming shift covering the startup sequence progress, process parameter trends, and operator attention items"
