| Title   | Simulate and Analyze Production Scenarios                                                         |
| As a    | Operations Manager                                                                                |
| I want  | the Simulation Agent to model different production scenarios and analyze their potential outcomes |
| So that | I can make informed decisions about process changes and optimizations                             |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The agent can create accurate simulations of the production environment
2. The agent provides detailed analysis reports for each simulated scenario
3. The agent can compare multiple scenarios and recommend optimal strategies
4. I can review simulation results and use them for strategic planning

# Properties

- **Skills:** Process simulation, Scenario modeling, Data visualization

- **Deontics:** Must use accurate data for simulations, Must provide unbiased analysis, Must consider multiple factors in scenarios

- **Task Prompts:** 
  - "Simulate the impact of increasing production speed by 10% on overall OEE"
  - "Model the effects of implementing a new maintenance strategy on equipment availability"
  - "Compare three different production schedules and recommend the most efficient option"
