## Potential Failure Modes

The team must be aware of and monitor for the following potential failure modes in fermentation tanks:

1. Contamination Issues
   - Microbial Contamination (e.g., bacteriophages)
   - Chemical Contamination
2. Process Control Failures
   - Temperature Control Issues
   - Pressure Control Problems
3. Material Degradation
   - Corrosion
4. Sanitation Failures
5. Mechanical Failures
   - Agitation System Breakdown
   - Sensor Malfunctions

## Conclusion

This team manifest outlines the structure, objectives, and key considerations for the Fermentation Tank Optimization Team in pharmaceutical antibiotic production. By leveraging specialized AI agents and addressing potential failure modes, the team aims to optimize fermentation processes, ensure product quality, and maintain regulatory compliance.
